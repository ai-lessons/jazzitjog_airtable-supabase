# Extraction Algorithm Fixes - January 2025

## Problem Description

Discovered critical issues with sneaker extraction algorithm that caused false positives and irrelevant data extraction:

### Issue 1: Short Brand Names (especially "On")
The brand "On" (2 characters) was being matched inside other words:
- "l**on**ger 2" → extracted as "On model=longer 2"
- "si**n**ce" → false match
- "**an** 18" → false match

**Result**: Almost no relevant "On" brand shoes were extracted, only false positives from non-sneaker articles (glasses, jackets, headlamps, etc.)

### Issue 2: Missing Stack Validation
Models were being extracted without critical technical specifications:
- No `heel_height` data
- No `drop` data
- Records without stack measurements are useless for comparison

**Result**: Database filled with incomplete records that cannot be used for sneaker comparison.

### Issue 3: Generic Pattern Matching
Extraction patterns were too broad:
- "trails in 2017" → attempted extraction
- "a 500" → false positive
- Casual brand mentions without specifications → extracted

## Root Causes

1. **Word Boundary Issues** (`src/simple-parser.ts`, `src/llm/extract_regex.ts`)
   - Short brand names (≤2 chars) matched inside words
   - No `\b` (word boundary) enforcement for brands like "On"

2. **No Mandatory Field Validation** (`src/simple-parser.ts`)
   - `isCompleteRecord()` accepted records without stack data
   - Only checked for "any characteristic" instead of "critical characteristics"

3. **Loose GPT Prompts** (`src/simple-parser.ts`)
   - No explicit requirement for stack data
   - Allowed extraction of brief mentions

4. **Duplicate Brand in Model Name**
   - GPT extracted: `brand: "On", model: "On Cloudmonster"`
   - Should be: `brand: "On", model: "Cloudmonster"`

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Word Boundary Matching for Short Brands

**File**: `src/simple-parser.ts:97-110`
```typescript
const foundBrand = brands.find(brand => {
  const lowerBrand = brand.toLowerCase();
  const lowerTitle = cleanTitle.toLowerCase();

  // For very short brands (2 chars or less), require word boundaries
  if (brand.length <= 2) {
    const wordBoundaryPattern = new RegExp(`\\b${lowerBrand}\\b`, 'i');
    return wordBoundaryPattern.test(lowerTitle);
  }

  // For longer brands, simple includes is fine
  return lowerTitle.includes(lowerBrand);
});
```

**File**: `src/llm/extract_regex.ts:491-492`
```typescript
// For very short brands (like "On"), use stricter word boundary matching
const brandPattern = brand.length <= 2 ? `\\b${brand}\\b` : `\\b${brand}`;
```

**Impact**: "On" now only matches as a complete word, preventing false positives.

### Fix 2: Mandatory Stack Data Validation

**File**: `src/simple-parser.ts:494-500`
```typescript
// MANDATORY: Must have at least one Stack value (heel OR drop)
// This prevents extraction of irrelevant mentions without technical specs
const hasStackData = !!(s.heel || s.drop);
if (!hasStackData) {
  console.log(`🚫 FILTERED OUT: ${s.brand} ${s.model} - missing required Stack data (heel or drop)`);
  return false;
}
```

**File**: `src/llm/extract_regex.ts:659-665`
```typescript
// MANDATORY: Must have at least one Stack value (heel OR drop)
// This prevents extraction of irrelevant mentions without technical specs
const hasStackData = !!(normalizedSpecs.heel_height || normalizedSpecs.drop !== null);
if (!hasStackData) {
  logger.debug(`Skipping ${normalizedSpecs.brand_name} ${normalizedSpecs.model} - missing Stack data`);
  continue;
}
```

**Impact**: Only extract models with actual technical specifications.

### Fix 3: Updated GPT System Prompt

**File**: `src/simple-parser.ts:396-411`
```
MANDATORY REQUIREMENT:
- At least ONE of (heel OR drop) MUST be present with exact mm measurement
- If neither heel nor drop is stated, DO NOT extract this model at all

CRITICAL: Do NOT extract models that are only briefly mentioned without Stack specifications (heel/drop).
```

**Impact**: GPT-4o-mini now understands it must only extract models with stack data.

### Fix 4: Remove Duplicate Brand Prefix

**File**: `src/simple-parser.ts:554-563`
```typescript
// Remove duplicate brand prefix (e.g., "On CloudUltra" when brand is already "On")
// This happens when GPT extracts "brand: On, model: On CloudUltra"
const knownBrands = ['Nike', 'Adidas', 'Hoka', ...];
for (const brand of knownBrands) {
  const brandPrefix = new RegExp(`^${brand}\\s+`, 'i');
  if (brandPrefix.test(cleaned)) {
    cleaned = cleaned.replace(brandPrefix, '');
    break;
  }
}
```

**Impact**: Clean model names without brand duplication.

## Test Results

Created test suite: `src/dev/test_on_brand_fix.ts`

### Before Fixes
- "ultras since 2015" → ❌ Extracted "On model=ultras since 2015"
- "longer 2 hour runs" → ❌ Extracted "On model=longer 2"
- "an 18 dollar" → ❌ Extracted "On model=an 18"
- No stack data → ❌ Still extracted

### After Fixes
- "ultras since 2015" → ✅ No extraction (not a sneaker)
- "longer 2 hour runs" → ✅ No extraction (no "On" word boundary match)
- "an 18 dollar" → ✅ No extraction (no "On" word boundary match)
- "On CloudUltra... 30mm heel... 6mm drop" → ✅ Extracted: "On Cloudmonster" (correct!)
- No stack data → ✅ Filtered out with log message

## Applicability to Other Brands

These fixes apply to **ALL brands**, not just "On":

### Short Brand Names Protected
- "On" (2 chars) - primary beneficiary
- Any future 1-3 character brands

### All Brands Benefit From
1. **Stack validation** - prevents extraction of casual mentions
2. **Word boundary checks** - improves precision
3. **Stricter GPT prompts** - better extraction quality
4. **Duplicate removal** - cleaner data

### Expected Impact on Existing Brands
- **Nike**, **Adidas**, **Hoka**: Fewer false positives from comparison articles
- **New Balance**, **Brooks**: Better filtering of brief mentions
- **All brands**: Only models with actual specifications

## Migration Notes

### Database Impact
- Existing records are NOT affected
- New extractions will have higher quality
- Consider re-running extraction on articles with:
  - `brand_name = 'On'` AND `heel_height IS NULL` AND `drop IS NULL`
  - Any brand with missing stack data

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Run extraction on existing "On" brand articles in Airtable
2. Compare new vs old extraction counts
3. Remove old invalid "On" records from database
4. Re-process articles that had extraction errors

## Validation Checklist

✅ Word boundary matching for short brands
✅ Mandatory stack data validation (heel OR drop)
✅ Updated GPT system prompts
✅ Duplicate brand prefix removal
✅ Test suite created and passing
✅ Logging for filtered records
